# 2019-Nigerian-Presidential-Election-Analysis

The country of Nigeria is divided into 36 states and six regions. The Nigerian Presidential Election is one of the most important elections in the country because it determines the fates of Nigerians for the next four years of a single tenure that is renewable once, as stipulated by the constitution. 

The 2019 general election which took place on the 23rd -24th February 2019 was the most expensive in Nigerian election history, costing N189.2 billion compared to N120 billion for the 2015 elections.*

The data for the 2019 presidential candidates of Nigeria's two major contemporary political parties 
( i.e.  All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ) was analyzed in order to identify the states and regions that gave both candidates the most votes.
